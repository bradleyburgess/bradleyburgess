## Hi, I'm Bradley

I love things with keyboards. Seriously. 🎹🎵🖥️

I started life as a pianist, "graduated" to the pipe organ (why have one keyboard 
when FIVE will do?), and now am transitioning to a career in tech.

I work primarily in Javascript/Typescript and Python. I'm passionate about open-source 
software, and use it as often as I possibly can. I love tinkering, and have built a NAS — 
hardware included — with Debian, docker, and free and open-source software.

You can find me on Bluseky: [@bburgesskeys.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/bburgesskeys.bsky.social). 
Feel free to reach out!
