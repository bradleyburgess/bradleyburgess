## Hi, I'm Bradley

I love things with keyboards. Seriously. 🎹🎵🖥️

I started life as a pianist, "graduated" to the pipe organ (why have one keyboard when FIVE will do?).

I love tech as well, though, and I have been doing web dev as a hobby for a while now.

I'm currently interested in [11ty](https://11ty.dev), but in general I work with Javascript. I'm also becoming more and more interested in a11y, and am trying to learn as much as I can about building ethical and accessible websites.

You can find me on twtter: [@bburgess_keys](https://twitter.com/bburgess_keys). Feel free to reach out!
