## Hi, I'm Bradley

I love things with keyboards. Seriously. üéπüéµüñ•Ô∏è

I started life as a pianist, "graduated" to the pipe organ (why have one keyboard 
when FIVE will do?), and now am transitioning to a career in tech.

I work primarily in Javascript/Typescript and Python, but I'm also learning C#/.NET and loving it as well. 
I'm passionate about open-source software, and use it as often as I possibly can. I love tinkering, and 
have built a NAS ‚Äî hardware included ‚Äî with Debian, docker, and free and open-source software.

You can find me on Bluseky ([@bburgesskeys.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/bburgesskeys.bsky.social)) 
or LinkedIn ([in/bburgesskeys](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bburgesskeys). 
Feel free to reach out!
